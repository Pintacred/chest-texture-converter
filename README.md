# chest-texture-converter
Chest Texture Converter converts the minecraft chest texture from Java Edition to Bedrock Edtiion, and vice versa, with just a few clicks of buttons. This is to save you a headache from trying to manually rearrange the faces of the texture to the other locations. Especially the nightmare which is the java double chest.
